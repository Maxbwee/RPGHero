# RPGHero

The application was created by Max Bowen alone.


## Functionality

The task was to create a class based RPG system where a hero can be created and given a subclass. There are four classes to choose from:

Mage,

Rogue,

Warrior,

Ranger.

Heroes can be leveled up and they gain level attributes accordingly (Strength, Dexterity and Intelligence)

Weapons and armour can be created and equipped on heroes. Some heroes have limitations to what kind of armour and weapons they can equip. 

## Testing

The application is "run" and tested based on JUnit tests

Code coverage can be seen in the following screenshot

There is also a test report using github actions.
